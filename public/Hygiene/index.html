<p>Before you start volunteering, please read this page carefully and watch the <a href="#volunteering-hygiene-video">‘Volunteering Hygiene Recommendation Video’</a>. People are self-isolating to avoid health risks for themselves and others. This is especially important since you will be helping vulnerable members of our society who may be at a higher risk of experiencing severe symptoms as a result of COVID-19 or people who may carry the virus. These two groups should not come into contact with one another. We must do our very best to maintain the necessary social distancing while helping our communities.</p>
<p>All recommended hygiene guidelines below, including our ‘Volunteering Hygiene Recommendation Video’ have been reviewed by health care professionals and approved by Professor Mayur Lakhani <a href="https://www.westleicestershireccg.nhs.uk/your-ccg/board-members/18-your-ccg/board-members/100-professor-mayur-lakhani-ccg-chair">https://www.westleicestershireccg.nhs.uk/your-ccg/board-members/18-your-ccg/board-members/100-professor-mayur-lakhani-ccg-chair</a>  (Immediate Past President of the Royal College of GPs) for your safety and the safety of the people you are helping.</p>
<p><strong>At all times your own government&rsquo;s advice is to be followed. This page merely offers a recommendation of how to apply these guidelines when volunteering.</strong> This page merely offers a recommendation of how to apply these guidelines when volunteering.</p>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep 2 meters (6 feet) distance to everyone, especially the person you are helping but also the other volunteers.
<img src="http://StudentsAgainstCorona.co.uk/imgs/social_distancing.png" alt="Social Distancing"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not touch your face or other people, especially the person you are helping.
<img src="http://StudentsAgainstCorona.co.uk/imgs/avoid.png" alt="Avoid Touching Your Face"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cough or sneeze into your elbow or into a tissue that you dispose of immediately.
<img src="http://StudentsAgainstCorona.co.uk/imgs/protect.png" alt="Protect others from getting sick"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If possible, we recommend using hand sanitizer before and after touching anything that will then come into contact with the person you are helping.
<img src="http://StudentsAgainstCorona.co.uk/imgs/hand_sanitizer.jpg" alt="Hand Sanitizer"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not wear gloves or face masks without informing yourself of the WHO Guidelines on when and how to use them. Both can increase the risk of spreading the virus if these guidelines are not followed.
