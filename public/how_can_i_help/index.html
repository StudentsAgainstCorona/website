                <p>With universities having closed around the world, several full-time students

<h2 id="follow-your-governments-advice">Follow Your Government’s Advice:</h2>
<p>It is vital that you adhere to the advice and measures that have been prescribed by your respective governments – washing your hands and social distancing are two simple examples.</p>
<p><em>If your government has asked you to quarantine and not leave your home, please ensure you get permission before leaving in an attempt to help!</em></p>
<p>Inform yourself by reading the guidelines published by your national health service and keep in mind these are updated regularly!</p>

<ul>
<li>Wash your hands regularly</li>
<li>Cough and sneeze into a tissue and bin it OR at least, into the inside of your elbow</li>
<li>Do not shake hands</li>
<li>Stay home if you are feeling unwell with any of the Covid-19 symptoms</li>

<h2 id="for-medical-students">For Medical Students:</h2>
<p>Are you a medical student and want to help out? Many hospitals have platforms where medical students can sign up to volunteer. Whether it involves helping patients in hospitals or speaking to concerned citizens about their symptoms over the phone, your help is essential. Please reach out to your local hospitals to see where your skills can be best utilized.</p>
<h2 id="blood-donations">Blood Donations:</h2>
<p>With people isolating themselves the world over, supplies of blood are diminishing. Blood is vital and blood donors are needed to keep supplies up. Contact your local blood bank to find out if they are in need.</p>
