Students in towns and cities across the world are coming together to help out the most vulnerable members of our communities affected by the coronavirus crisis.
 
Whether itâ€™s buying a carton of milk or walking the dog, there are simple tasks that people in isolation or at high-risk cannot perform on their own. We have a responsibility to both #flattenthecurve and take concrete action to lighten the burden on those most affected.
 
As the public health situation unfolds, our movement provides a strong platform to connect volunteers with those who need help. StudentsAgainstCorona stresses (inter)national hygiene guidelines to avoid spreading the virus between volunteers and, most importantly, to those at-risk individuals who we are helping. We urge all volunteers to thoroughly read the [Recommended Hygiene Guidelines for Volunteers](/how_can_i_help) and watch the instructional video before performing any tasks.
 
If you are healthy, and at low risk, join this movement to help others in your community!
