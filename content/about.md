Students in towns and cities across the world are coming together to help out the most vulnerable members of our communities affected by the Covid-19 crisis.
 
Whether itâ€™s buying a carton of milk or walking the dog, there are simple tasks that people in isolation or at high-risk cannot perform on their own. We have a responsibility to both #flattenthecurve and take concrete action to lighten the burden on those most affected.
 
As the public health situation unfolds, our movement will help coordinate young people around the world, assigning them small but important tasks.
 
If you are healthy, and at low risk, join this movement to help others in your community!
